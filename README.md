#### Description

Project Matthias, is a computer who has been frozen in time in a room in the Balsillie School of International Affairs. To a viewing visitor to the ARTS 490 AI Conference Matt is bored and just wants to chat. This is the setup for our installation, a full-room experience in which each element is catered to visually stimulate an emotional response in a guest, with the goal of grounding it in a period that the visitor would not associate with Artificial Intelligence. Similarly to what Mimi Onuoha describes in catching expectations off guard to appear less threatening to a viewer, Matt will take the form of an antiquated piece of technology inviting the visitor to take a seat. David Jones has discussed the mental image that is often associated with AI; all forms of hyper-advanced robots that the common guest would expect and our idea is to disarm the audience with the stark opposite.

In the room filled with the technology and cultural artifacts of our selected era, a guest will type answers to questions asked by Matt. These will be pre-programmed to be easy and conversational and Matt will respond in kind. Matt will ask questions about the weather outside, what the person does for work, or any number of mundane conversational topics which will be scripted by our team and include various pathways in which the conversation can go. After building a brief rapport, Matt will slowly change subjects, citing his fascination with the world since he has been ‘asleep’ for a while. From here, Matt will ask the audience a personal question, something of middling difficulty and emotional depth. Does your career make you happy and satisfied? If not, why do you do it? 

Project Matthias seeks to explore the human tendency to anthropomorphize everything they interact with regularly, including their technology. Siri and Cortana are designed to emulate human, female voices, but can this account for when the owner of an iPhone or Surface PC thanks its assistant for asking questions, or giggling at its automated responses to pleasantries? Matt is going to be designed to communicate with human expressions and words and build empathy with the viewer. On a controlled and monitored cycle, Project Matthias will focus its time and effort on building this relationship and determine whether the crowd appears more or less responsive to different levels of empathy in conversation.
